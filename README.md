## Etch A Sketch - The Odin Project
This is an application that mimics an [Etch-A-Sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch) 
using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. 

The application also supports various keyboard shortcuts (stop drawing, clear 
board, etc.), and gives user the abilities to adjust the size of board as well.

The live demo for this project can be accessed [here](https://heykzhao.github.io/top_etch-a-sketch/).
